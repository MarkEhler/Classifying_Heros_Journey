    "# NLP For Heros\n",
    "Jophseph Campbell,  Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence and author for The Hero With One Thousand Faces (THWOTF), is widely regarded as the theoretical word on fiction writing.  In writing THWOTF he lays out an architypal story arc that certain hero's journey stories follow.  The idea of simplifying a story down to basic components is nothing new, but the hero's journey in particular seems to follow his outline very, very closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification has inspired me to try and model this storyline using the Classic J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Soccerer's Stone.  IN J.K.'s work, she very closely follows the archetype.  Often breaking each step down by chapter.  This, and it's simple language, as it is meant as a children's book after all, should make it a clear and natural choice as the labeled data for this experiment."
